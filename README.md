# Udacity Review

## Meets Specifications
Fantastic :rocket: :zap: :star:
You have successfully completed this project.
You have met all the requirements and demonstrated all your competence and quality.
Keep working on the course. There are several fun challenges ahead :muscle:

## Features
Entering whole numbers in the "Height" and "Width" fields, and submitting the form, causes an empty grid to appear on the page.

✅ Fantastic job using querySelector to get the inputs!

Choosing a color from the color selector and clicking on a grid square causes that grid square (and only that square) to change color.

Event listeners are properly added to the grid squares (and not to the border or the table itself).

✅ Awesome work here! You got colorPicker value when a cell is clicked, coloring it correctly.

If there are already colored squares in the grid, clicking the Submit button clears them out.

✅ Working fine! :clap:

## Code Quality
The script.js file is properly linked to the HTML file, and loading the HTML file shows the correct functionality for the application.

Note: You do not need to edit the HTML and CSS files to make your project work (but you can if you want to).

Code is correctly indented, uses descriptive variable names for long-lived variables, and has descriptive comments.

✅ Your code is well-indented, with good comments and descriptive variable names.

Open the Developer Tools console tab, then create a grid and color some squares in it. You shouldn't see any error messages.
